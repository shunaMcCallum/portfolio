                        the lead on planning and managing each stage of the project. I also built components which I had not coded before, and very much enjoyed taking part in group
                        programming sessions. This project built on my experience of creating interactive applications, and building features to provide a more in-depth experience for
                        the user, such as a dynamic background and the ability to create a user profile which can track which countries users have studied. </p>
