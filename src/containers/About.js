            <p>Background in planning and project management within the classical music sector, primarily focused on delivering small to
                large-scale performances of opera (both live and filmed), as well as developing and maintaining administrative processes.
                This work highlighted the importance of communication, teamwork and delivery of high-quality work, and developed these as
                key part of my skill set. Other key skills included eye for detail and managing the requirements of a wide variety of
                different stakeholders.</p>
            <p>I began studying programming in my spare time as I was looking for a new challenge, and at CodeClan have developed this into
                a passion which I now hope to turn into a career. I like to push myself out of my comfort zone in order to gain new experiences
                and develop my skills to as high a level as possible, and Iâ€™m always eager to learn more.</p>
